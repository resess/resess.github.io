        		<h1>ReSeSS - The Reliable, Secure, and Sustainable Software Lab</h1>
				<p>The Reliable, Secure, and Sustainable Software Lab (ReSeSS) is led by <a href="http://www.ece.ubc.ca/~mjulia/index.html">Dr. Julia Rubin</a>. It aims at improving software integrity and robustness. We develop novel solutions for analyzing and improving existing software and for building new software efficiently and effectively. Our main focus is currently on mobile software and on large distributed cloud-based systems. Through research projects, seminars, and industrial collaborations, our lab members are exposed to a wide range of topics in security, reliability, energy-efficiency, and large-scale software development.</p>
