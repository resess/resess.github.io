We develop novel solutions for analyzing and improving existing software and for building new software efficiently and effectively. Our main focus is currently on mobile software and on large distributed cloud-based systems. Through research projects, seminars, and industrial collaborations, our lab members are exposed to a wide range of topics in security, reliability, energy-efficiency, and large-scale software development.	</p>
