The structure of the backend must comply with the following guidelines:

# Backend Structure

Typescript code of the backend Node.js application is under the `/backend` folder. 

- Organize code by architecture layers into the following packages: 

```
├── /src
│	├── /routes         # Define all the endpoints and link them to controllers. 
│	├── /controllers    # Handle incoming HTTP requests.
│	├── /services       # Contain the business logic. 
│	├── /repositories   # Data access functions.
│	├── /models         # Define the structure of the data (e.g., database schemas). 
│	├── /config         # Store configuration such as environment variables or DB settings.
│	├── /middleware     # Functions that process requests and responses before they reach route handlers or after responses are generated. Such functions handle cross-cutting concerns, such as API authentication, logging, input and output validation, etc. 
│	├── /types          # Store the shared custom TypeScript type definitions and interfaces.
│	└── /utils          # Store the helper or utility functions.
├──  /tests	            # Contains tests. 
└── /docs               # Store the OpenAPI specification of backend APIs.
```

- Inside `/routes`, `/controllers`, `/services`, `/repositories`, `/models` folders, organize files by the following domains: User, VotingGroup, and Movie.
