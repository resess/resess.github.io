The project implementation must comply with the following security guidelines:
- Use HTTPS for all communications. 
- Protect all backend APIs with proper authentication and authorization. 
- Validate and sanitize all inputs to prevent injection attacks. 
- Store sensitive configuration in environment variables instead of hardcoding them in code. 
- Implement rate limiting on backend API endpoints and external APIs to prevent abuse. 
- Follow the principle of least privilege for API access.
