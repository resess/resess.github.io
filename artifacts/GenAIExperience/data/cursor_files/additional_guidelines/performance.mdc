The project implementation must comply with the following performance optimization guidelines:
- Use dynamic loading for non-critical components. 
- Implement caching strategies for frequently accessed data. 
- Optimize API response times. 
- Optimize image and asset delivery. 
- Ensure database schemas and queries are optimized with proper indexing for performance. 
- Use lazy loading and pagination for large datasets. 
- Use efficient algorithms and data structures.
