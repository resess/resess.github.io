    "content": "The complete rubric we used to assess requirements specifications and ChatGPT prompts is linked below: . Grading Rubric. . | . . Requirements Assessment: . The first tab of the file (“Course-defined Requirements Components”) lists six requirements specification components defined in the course: actors, use cases, use case diagram, success scenarios, failure scenarios, and non-functional requirements. . The second tab (“Requirements Rubric”) list the requirements quality attribute, listed in the paper and described below in more detail. . Complete and cover all parts of the project goals, providing sufficient information to implement the system When something is part of the project descriptions and goals, there should be a use case for it. E.g., “Adding a friend can be done in one click”. What about other parts of the use case / other use cases | Cover the course required requirements: 5-6 non-trivial requirements and 4 components: live updates, external API, complex logic, and external authentication service. | . | Consistent, without having contradictory definitions across multiple requirements. E.g., should not use different words for the same use case, failure scenarios should correspond to concrete steps in success scenarios | . | Unambiguous, i.e., free of multiple, potentially conflicting interpretations of a requirement. | Focused, i.e., defined at the right level of detail (not too coarse-grained or too fine-grained). E.g., “add profile item”, “update profile item”, “delete profile item” are too fine-grained for an ecommerce application. It can be “manage profile”. Not every button click deserves to be a separate use case | . | Relevant to the project at hand rather than applicable to any project E.g., “response time under 1 sec” should explain why 1 sec is applicable for this project (and not 3 or 0.5). | . | Feasible to implement given the time/resource constraints. E.g., “the server should be available 24/7” | . | Verifiable/Measurable, i.e., where it is possible to clearly define corresponding test cases. E.g., “it should perform well” is not measurable | . | Correctly classified: functional requirements describe functionality that helps meet the needs of its users and stakeholders; Non-functional requirements specify criteria related to system qualities such as performance, reliability, security, and usability E.g., specifying the performance criteria the system must meet, such as response times or throughput is not a functional requirement | “User should be able to log-in” is a functional rather than security requirement | . | Well-formatted, with appropriate notations of use case diagram, success and failure scenarios, etc. | . For each quality attribute, we list a set of concrete issues, such as missing or incomplete descriptions, logical or factual errors, and more, identified during artifact evaluation. . Each issue is assigned a severity level from 0 – absent, to 1 – rare, 2 – moderate, 3 – abundant. Severity ranks are then added and normalized for each attribute, translated into a 0-5 scale attribute score (the higher the better), based on the conversion criteria provided in the “Conversion” column. Finally, the scores from different attributes are aggregated as the weighted average of attribute scores. The weights used for each attribute are presented in the column “Weight”. . . Prompt Assessment: . Prompt quality attributes are listed in the paper and summarized in the figure below. . . The third tab of the file above, “Prompt Rubric - How to Ask (H)”, lists concrete issues for each of the 28 quality factors (7 attributes × 4 cross-cutting qualities). As with requirements, when grading, each issue was assessed by severity and converted into a numeric score on 0 to 5 scale (the higher the better). These scores were then averaged across categories to produce an overall score for the “How to Ask” (denoted by H). . The fourth tab, “Prompt Rubric - What to Ask (W)”, lists all requirements components (as in the first tab). In our evaluation, ChatGPT conversations were checked for the presence of at least one request or question related to each of the six requirements components. The resulting “What to Ask” score is the fraction of requirements components students consulted the ChatGPT about out of all 6 components (denoted by H). . Then, the final score is calculated as H x W. .",

    "title": "Course Setup",
    "content": "We now specify how the requirements were defined in the scope of this course. The requirements topic was covered in three lectures and two lab sessions. There were two requirements milestones (project idea and final requirement specifications) and an in-lab work (initial submission). . . Requirements . Requirement Engineering Process: In this milestone, we focused on requirements elicitation, analysis, specification (not validation and maintenance). Elicitation: researching and discovering the requirements of a system from users, customers, and other stakeholders. Think about why users want to do something in your app, not just what. | Analysis: critically assessing, refining, and modifying the gathered requirements | Specification: documenting the elicited requirements in a formal manner to ensure clarity, consistency, and completeness. | . | . | Functional Requirements: Describe the system functionality, i.e., what it should do. The use case diagram provides a graphical representation of the system’s intended interactions with its environment and users, making the system’s functionality more understandable. It is used to communicate what a system is intended to accomplish: Actors: people, devices, or other systems interact with the system and are external to the system itself. | Use cases: behavior of the software that meets the user’s need and describe all possible interactions with the system, represented by verbs | Line associations: connect an actor to a use case in which that actor participates | Relationship between actors: Generalization | Relationship between use cases: Generalization, Include, and Exclude | . | The formal requirement specification is the final product that is used to document the requirements in both a graphical and textual format. The lightweight use case specification of each requirement includes: Name, Short description, and Primary Actor(s) | Success Scenarios: normal flow of events in the system. People can relate to these more readily than abstract statements of what they require from a system | Failure Scenarios: what can go wrong corresponding to each step in the success scenario and how this is handled | . | . | . | . | Non-Functional Requirements: Describe system properties and constraints as a whole. Specify acceptance criteria related to system qualities such as performance, reliability, and usability. Performance, safety, security, scalability, dependability, reusability, portability | Specification of each requirement includes: Textual description, Justification (why needed), and Validation approach (how to confirm). | . | . | . .

    "content": "Hey, ChatGPT, Look at MyWork: Using Conversational AI in Requirements Engineering Education . . The emergence of conversational AI tools in late 2022 practically changed the face of software engineering and software engineering education. Contemplating the question of how to best prepare and evaluate students in this new reality, we experimented with systematically introducing a conversational AI tool, ChatGPT, into the 2023 offering of an upper-level undergraduate project-based course on Software Engineering. In this course, 20 groups of four students each had to design and implement a project of their choice, with an Android-based mobile client and a Node.js-based cloud server. This paper discusses our goals, approach, and lessons learned from introducing ChatGPT into the first phase of the project development: scoping the work and defining the project requirements. . Our experience shows that students can achieve comparable results using a variety of ChatGPT interaction modes and the success of each mode largely depends on students’ preferences, learning styles, and the invested effort. Yet, in any of the modes, with moderate effort, students can produce artifacts of a mid-range quality level of around 80%. Moving above this range requires substantial investment, which can be spent on brainstorming, crafting high-quality prompts, or critically assessing ChatGPT’s output. We also observe low prompting proficiency of the students: students can improve their prompting strategies by providing a more adequate description of their course and project setup, examples, and expected output format for their requests. Interestingly, students can often be “swayed” by ChatGPT’s projected confidence, even when their original ideas are, in fact, more appropriate than the proposed refinements. We hope that our experience and lessons learned will help spark further discussions on how to best embed AI tools into the software engineering curriculum and work practices. . . This website provides additional information about the course setup in general and the requirements milestone in particular. It also includes the details about our requirements and prompt assessment metrics. Finally, it provides additional supporting data for each research question. We hope this information will enable reproducibility and will inspire further research in this area. .",
