	<button class="collapsible">Clear Writing = Clear Thinking</button>
	<div class="content">
		Excellently written by <a href="https://www.victorcheng.com/">Victor Cheng</a>:
		<br><p><br>
	        
		<b>Fuzzy writing often reflects fuzzy thinking</b>. 
		One of the best ways to improve your thinking is to articulate your thoughts in writing. 
		When you write out your thoughts, you have something to analyze, revise, and improve.
		
		<br><p>
		<b>Editing = Clarifying your thinking </b>.
		The more you write and edit, the clearer your thinking becomes.<br> 
		Here are three tips for clarifying your writing/thinking:</p>
		<ol>
		<li><b>Structure your Thoughts.</b> <br> 
		When possible, group similar ideas together into distinct categories of information. 
		One of the easiest ways to confuse an audience is to not organize your thoughts into categories.
		The second easiest way to confuse an audience is to violate your own categorization structure.<br><p>
		<br>
		For example, there are three steps to riding a bicycle: <br>
		a) starting <br>
		b) coasting <br>
		c) stopping <br>
		<br>
		This is a clear structure. 
		Explaining the concept of pedals clearly belongs in the first category on “starting.” 
		Explaining the role of brakes clearly belongs in the last category on "stopping." 
		If you discuss brakes during starting, and pedals during stopping (assuming you’re using handbrakes), the content doesn’t fit the structure. 
		Readers find this confusing.
		In addition, let's say your written work includes the following sentence: “Don’t forget to oil your bike chain regularly to ensure proper functioning.”
		This comment doesn’t fit your structure.
		It sticks out.
		<br><p>
		This leads me to my second tip:

		<li> <b>Stay Focused by Eliminating Extraneous Ideas</b>. <br>
		Quite often, less is more. 
		It is better to convey an idea simply and cleanly than to cram more information in that doesn’t fit the focus of your written document.
		<br><p>

		<li><b>Be Concise by Editing Ruthlessly</b>. <br> 
		As you review your work, ask yourself the following question (over and over again):
		Can I eliminate this word, phrase, or paragraph without changing the meaning? 
		If so, delete it.
		Clear writing comes from getting your key ideas across while using not one word more or less than necessary. 
		Clear thinking comes from focusing on the single most important crux of your thought -- rather than swimming in a sea of jumbled ideas. 
		The better you get at editing your writing, the better you will automatically get at thinking more concisely.
		</ol>
		Structure. Focus. Conciseness.

		 <li>Use PowerPoint (not Keynote) for your presentations and format the slides as

		 <li>Fonts in all presentations should always be at least 18 points. </li>
		 <li>Always include slide numbers.</li>
		 <li>Do not use the equation feature, just symbols. </li>
		 <li>One message per slide, one slide per message. </li>
		 <li>A good slide should not contain more than 30-40 words (20 is the target). </li>
		 <li>Do not write in full sentences. Break your message into bullet points.</li>

                    <li>Run the script created in Step 4, use the emulator name written down in Step 3 (it is passed to the script as the first parameter). For example,<br>
