						"content": "Benchmarks\n\nSources and sinks\n\nWe provided the list of sources and sinks we used for benchmark apps (SS-Bench) in Section 3.3.2 (Table 3) of our paper.\n\nSelected benchmarks and expected results\n\nThis section contains (1) the full list of benchmarks (from DroidBench and ICCBench) that we used in our study, (2) target criterion of each application, and (3) the ground truth we followed, determined by the list of sources/sinks and tool configurations we used.\nThere are seven columns in the table. Here we explain every column and provide suggestions to the readers about how to read the table:\n\n\n  Category: In DroidBench and ICCBench, authors put benchmarks to different folders based on what aspect of Android/Java the benchmark is designed to test. We extracted the folder name as categories, and numbered them.\n  AppID: We numbered all benchmarks in DroidBench we use, from 1 to 158, obeying the order of “Category”. The same to ICCBench benchmarks.\n  AppName: The name of the benchmark, which are extracted from DroidBench and ICCBench test suites.\n  TargetCriteriaID and TargetCriteriaDesciption: Each of the DroidBench and ICCBench application is designed to test a particular aspect of taint analysis, which we refer to as the Target Criterion (short as Criterion) of the benchmark. Developers generally annotate the criterion in source code. We extract this information from DroidBench and ICCBench applications annotations, which is the column “CriteriaDesciption”. For easy reference, we number each criterion in the format [Test Suite Name][Category ID][subid of application inside this category], for example, if we look at the first row, “DB1.1” means the criterion “Aliases must be computed precisely or a false positive will be found.” is tested by the first benchmark “Merge1” in the first category “Aliasing” in DroidBench test suite.\n  Number of designer’s expected flow(s): In DroidBench and ICCBench, developers annotated the number of expected leaks, which are what we extracted to this column.\n  Number of our expected flow(s): With our selection of sources, sinks, and configuration parameters discussed in previous subsections, the expected flows for each benchmark application might deviate from the result annotated by the benchmark designers. We thus manually analyzed each of the benchmark applications, extracting all flows expected under our configuration setup.\n\n\nAll benchmarks whose Number of designer’s expected flow(s) are different from Number of our expected flow(s) are highlighted in blue.\n\n\n    CategoryAppIDAppNameTargetCriteriaIDTargetCriteriaDescription# designer'sexpected flow(s)# our expectedflow(s)\n    DroidBench\n    1. Aliasing1FlowSensitivity1DB1.1Aliases must be computed in a flow-sensitive fashion, otherwise a false positive is found.00\n    2Merge1DB1.2Aliases must be computed precisely or a false positive will be found.01\n    3SimpleAliasing1DB1.3Aliases must be computed soundly or the leak will be missed.11\n    4StrongUpdate1DB1.4The alias analysis must support strong updates for not causing a false positive.10\n    2. Android Specific5ApplicationModeling1DB2.1Aliases must be computed precisely or a false positive will be found.10\n    6DirectLeak1DB2.2The value of a source is directly sent to a sink.11\n    7InactiveActivityDB2.3The analysis has to be aware that the activity is set to inactive in manifest file.00\n    8Library2DB2.4The analysis must correctly handle custom libraries.11\n    9LogNoLeakDB2.5The analysis has to be aware that no tainted value can reach the sink.00\n    10Obfuscation1DB2.6The analysis must not be fooled by fake implementations of system classes contained in the APK file.11\n    11Parcel1DB2.7Parcel marshall and unmarshalling.11\n    12PrivateDataLeak3DB2.8The analysis must propagate taints across file system accesses.21\n    13PublicAPIField1DB2.9Must have accurate modeling for API classes that expose fields.11\n    14PublicAPIField2DB2.10Analysis must have a model of Intent implementation to setter / getter of Intent fields.11\n    15View1DB2.11The analysis needs to properly include custom views into the lifecycle.11\n    3. Arrays And Lists16ArrayAccess1DB3.1The analysis must distinguish between different array positions to recognize that the tainted data does not get leaked.00\n    17ArrayAccess2DB3.2The analysis must distinguish between different array positions and has to evaluate the function to recognize that the tainted data does not get leaked.00\n    18ArrayAccess3DB3.3The analysis must support arrays.11\n    19ArrayAccess4DB3.4The analysis must correctly handle fields of objects inside arrays.00\n    20ArrayAccess5DB3.5The analysis must correctly distinguish between the size of an array and its elements.00\n    21ArrayCopy1DB3.6The analysis tool must have a model for System.arraycopy().11\n    22ArrayToString1DB3.7Have to model that Array.toString invokes toString() for each object of array.11\n    23HashMapAccess1DB3.8The analysis must distinguish between different hash map entries to recognize that the tainted data does not get leaked.00\n    24ListAccess1DB3.9The analysis must distinguish between different list positions to recognize that the tainted data does not get leaked.00\n    25MultidimensionalArray1DB3.10The analysis tool has to be able to track an element within a multidimensional array.11\n    4. Callbacks26AnonymousClass1DB4.1The analysis must handle callbacks, anonymous inner classes and static fields.22\n    27Button1DB4.2The analysis must analyze the layout xml file and take the lifecycle into account (onCreate is executed before user interaction).11\n    28Button2DB4.3The analysis must be able to analyze listeners, know that callback of button3 is ClickOnButton3 (defined in xml file) and has to handle the arbitrary order of the listener callbacks.33\n    29Button3DB4.4The analysis must be able to detect callback handlers registered in other callback handlers.11\n    30Button4DB4.5The analysis must analyze the layout xml file and correctly handle include directives.11\n    31Button5DB4.6Must correctly model that a Button is represented by a single object in the runtime, and that object is delivered to multiple calls of onClick.11\n    32LocationLeak1DB4.7The analysis must be able to emulate the Android activity lifecycle correctly, integrate the callback method onLocationChanged and detect the callback methods as source. This example contains a location information leakage in the onResume() callback method. The data source is placed into the onLocationChanged() callback method, especially the parameter loc.22\n    33LocationLeak2DB4.8The analysis must be able to emulate the Android activity lifecycle correctly, integrate the callback method onLocationChanged and detect the callback methods as source. This example contains a location information leakage in the onResume() callback method. The data source is placed into the onLocationChanged() callback method, especially the parameter loc. In contrast to LocationLeak1 the activity implements the Listener directly (no inner class).22\n    34LocationLeak3DB4.9The analysis must be able to emulate the Android activity lifecycle correctly, integrate the callback method onLocationChanged, detect the callback methods as source and connect the callback class to the activity via the interface.12\n    35MethodOverride1DB4.10The analysis must be able to detect the leak in an internal Android method that is overwritten.11\n    36MultiHandlers1DB4.11The analysis must be able to correctly associate callback handlers with the respective activities.00\n    37Ordering1DB4.12The analysis must take the order of callback registration and sink call into account.00\n    38RegisterGlobal1DB4.13The analysis must support globally-registered callback handlers.11\n    39RegisterGlobal211\n    40Unregister1DB4.14The analysis must take into accounts that callbacks can be unregistered again.00\n    5. Emulator Detection41Battery1DB5.1The (dynamic) analysis must avoid being detected and circumvented.11\n    42Bluetooth111\n    43Build111\n    44Contacts111\n    46DeviceId111\n    47File111\n    49IP111\n    50PI111\n    52PlayStore211\n    53Sensors111\n    54SubscriberId111\n    55VoiceMail111\n    45ContentProvider1DB5.2The (dynamic) analysis must avoid being detected and circumvented. Sends the IMEI as an SMS message and writes it to the log file. Emulator detection is performed on the IMEI and the app is killed if the IMEI is a 00..00 pattern.22\n    48IMEI1DB5.3The (dynamic) analysis must avoid being detected and circumvented. Sends the IMEI as an SMS message and writes it to the log file. Emulator detection is performed by cutting the secret message at an index computed on the IMEI which is known to always be 000..0 on an emulator.20\n    51PlayStore1DB5.4The (dynamic) analysis must avoid being detected and circumvented. Sends the IMEI as an SMS message and writes it to the log file. Emulator detection is performed by checking whether the Play Store app is installed on the system.22\n    6. Field And Object Sensitivity56FieldSensitivity1DB6.1The analysis must be able to distinguish between different fields of an object.00\n    57FieldSensitivity2DB6.2The analysis must be able to distinguish between different fields of an object. An object has two fields, the one that gets tainted is sent to a sink.00\n    58FieldSensitivity3DB6.3The analysis must be able to distinguish between different fields of an object. This is an easier version of FieldSensitivity1.11\n    59FieldSensitivity4DB6.4The analysis has to consider the order of the statements for tainted fields.00\n    60InheritedObjects1DB6.5The analysis must be able to decide on the subtype of a variable based on a condition.11\n    61ObjectSensitivity1DB6.6The analysis must be able to distinguish between two objects of the same type that are initialized by the same constructor.00\n    62ObjectSensitivity2DB6.7The analysis must be able to remove taints from variables and fields.00\n    7. General Java63Clone1DB7.1Must model clone of list.11\n    64Exceptions1DB7.2The analysis must handle exceptions.11\n    65Exceptions2DB7.3The analysis must handle implicit exceptions.11\n    66Exceptions3DB7.4The analysis must precisely model which exceptions can occur and which ones can't.00\n    67Exceptions4DB7.5The analysis must handle exception data.11\n    68Exceptions5DB7.6The analysis must handle exception data across method calls.11\n    69Exceptions611\n    70Exceptions7DB7.7The analysis must precisely handle exception types across method calls.00\n    71FactoryMethods1DB7.8The analysis must be able to handle factory methods contained in the operating system.22\n    72Loop1DB7.9The analysis must handle standard java constructs.11\n    73Loop211\n    74Serialization1DB7.10Must model serialization.11\n    75SourceCodeSpecific1DB7.11The analysis must handle standard java constructs.

In this section, we detailedly list our manual inspection results about sources of failures on a benchmark basis. The table below have multiple columns, we will describe each column and provide instructions on how to read the table.\n\nThe table consists of two main parts, which are:\n\n\n  App and TargetCriteriaID: These two columns are information of benchmarks, matching AppID+AppName, and TargetCriteriaID in Selected benchmarks and expected results table.\n  \n    The left columns are all about results of studied tools. We list details about FP (false positives) and FN (false negatives) flows reported by each tool. For each benchmark, we list:\n\n    \n      #FP/#FN: The number of FPs/FNs reported by a tool.\n      \n        FailingCriteria: Detailed breakdown of all FPs(/FNs) got reported by a tool on the benchmark. The format is [Number of FPs(/FNs)]x[FailingCriteria of The FPs(/FNs)]. Note that we highlighted flows reported by tools which are not original designed for the tool. We also included flows affected by special semantics of Amandroid and DroidSafe in this column, denoted by the following:\n\n        \n          SEM1: Amandroid and DroidSafe filter out intra-component flows for ICC-related sinks.\n          SEM2: DroidSafe reports the location of the entry method.\n        \n      \n    \n  \n\n\nLet’s take the benchmark ActivityCommunication2 as an example, what we can learn from the table is:\n\n\n  FlowDroid reported 1 FP due to criterion DB8.2. Details about the criterion can be found in table Selected benchmarks and expected results.\n  Amandroid reported 2 FPs. One FP is due to criterion DB8.2, which is expected, and an FN is due to criterion UBC4, which is unexpected.\n  DroidSafe successfully handled the benchmark, with no FP nor FN.\n\n\nDetails of our newly-identified sources of failures (i.e., UBCx) can be found here.\n\n\n    \n        AppName\n        TargetCriteriaID\n        FlowDroid v2.7.1\n        DroidRA + FlowDroid v2.7.1\n        Amandroid v3.2.0\n        DroidRA + Amandroid v3.2.0\n        DroidSafe\n        DroidRA + DroidSafe\n      \n      \n        FP\n        FN\n        FP\n        FN\n        FP\n        FN\n        FP\n        FN\n        FP\n        FN\n        FP\n        FN\n      \n      \n        #FP\n        Criteria\n        #FN\n        Criteria\n        #FP\n        Criteria\n        #FN\n        Criteria\n        #FP\n        Criteria\n        #FN\n        Criteria\n        #FP\n        Criteria\n        #FN\n        Criteria\n        #FP\n        Criteria\n        #FN\n        Criteria\n        #FP\n        Criteria\n        #FN\n        Criteria\n      \n      \n        DroidBench\n      \n    \n    1.

There are two differences in our experiments compared to the ISSTA’18 paper:\n\n\n  For selected Android static taint analyzers, we used FlowDroid v2.7.1 in this work vs. v2.0 in the earlier work, and Amandroid v3.2.0 vs. v3.1.1 in the earlier work. DroidSafe did not have any updates from the time of ISSTA’18.\n  For selected benchmark suites, we used DroidBench v3.0 instead of v2.0 as in the earlier work. We included 49 new benchmark apps from DroidBench v3.0 in out test suite. ICCBench did not have any updates from the time of ISSTA’18.\n\n\nIn the following two tables, we list benchmark apps on which different versions of FlowDroid and Amandroid reported inconsistent results. As we only ran benchmark apps in DroidBench v2.0 in our ISSTA’18 paper, we only present results for benchmark apps in DroidBench v2.0.\n\nSpecifically, these tables consists of the following two parts:\n\n\n  App and TargetCriteriaID: These two columns are information of benchmarks, matching AppID+AppName, and TargetCriteriaID in Selected benchmarks and expected results table.\n  Results of FlowDroid or Amandroid under different version. We list details about FP (false positives) and FN (false negatives) flows reported by FlowDroid v2.7.1 and v2.0 (in the first table) as well as Amandroid v3.2.0 and v3.1.1 (in the second table). We highlighted differences between two versions of each tool.\n\n\nDetails of our newly-identified sources of failures (i.e., UBCx) can be found here.\n\n\n    AppNameTargetCriteriaIDFlowDroid v2.7.1FlowDroid v2.0\n    FPFNFPFN\n    #FPCriteria#FNCriteria#FPCriteria#FNCriteria\n    DroidBench\n    11.

We listed the distribution of API levels of these Google Play apps in the following table.\n\nWe did not find any app of API level 6 or below, thus these API levels are omitted in the following table. In addition, there are 14 apps that we cannot extract the API levels.\n\n\n    API Level# of appsat this level (%)# of appsbelow this level (%)\n    72 (0.04%)2 (0.04%)\n    81 (0.02%)3 (0.05%)\n    92 (0.04%)5 (0.09%)\n    101 (0.02%)6 (0.11%)\n    110 (0.00%)6 (0.11%)\n    120 (0.00%)6 (0.11%)\n    131 (0.02%)7 (0.13%)\n    146 (0.11%)13 (0.23%)\n    150 (0.00%)13 (0.23%)\n    163 (0.05%)16 (0.29%)\n    173 (0.05%)19 (0.34%)\n    181 (0.02%)20 (0.36%)\n    199 (0.16%)29 (0.52%)\n    200 (0.00%)29 (0.52%)\n    2114 (0.25%)43 (0.77%)\n    2227 (0.48%)70 (1.26%)\n    2341 (0.74%)111 (1.99%)\n    2423 (0.41%)134 (2.41%)\n    2554 (0.97%)188 (3.38%)\n    26439 (7.88%)627 (11.26%)\n    27342 (6.14%)969 (17.40%)\n    283802 (68.27%)4771 (85.67%)\n    29782 (14.04%)5553 (99.71%)\n    302 (0.04%)5555 (99.75%)\n    Unknown14 (0.25%)NA\n    \n\nThe first step of our Google Play apps selection is to keep apps of API level 25 or below. This selection resulted in 188 apps.\n\nLogin Identification\n\nAfter retriving the API level of each app, we kept apps of API level 25 or below. This selection resulted in 188 apps. We then executed every app on a device for 20 minutes, and check whether the app contains any authentication functionality. We confirmed reliable authentication mechanism in 51 out of 188 apps.\n\nIn this section, we listed all 51 apps with reliable authentication mechanism. We also provide what type of login functionality we identified from each app.\n\nThe following table consists of these columns:\n\n\n  APILevel: The API level of an app. We sorted all the apps by their API levels, from the smallest one to the largest one.\n  AppName: The full package name of the app.\n  Category: On Google Play Store, apps are categorized into 58 categories, e.g., AUTO_AND_VEHICLES, BOOKS_AND_REFERENCE. We listed the category of an app on Google Play Store in this column. An app may from multiple categories, e.g., com.facebook.katana from both APPLICATION and SOCIAL categories. We confirmed that the APKs from different categories with the same app name are identical.\n  LoginType: What type of login functionality we identified from each app. There are mainly two types of login:\n    \n      Traditional: Login functionality is not delegated to third-party OAuth service providers.\n      OAuth (including Google Sign In, Facebook Login and Weibo): Login functionality is delegated to third-party OAuth service providers.\n    \n  \n  Included/Excluded: Whether we included or excluded an app. For apps that are excluded, we also provided the reason in parentheses.\n\n\n\n    APILevelAppNameCategoryLoginTypeIncluded/Excluded\n    14com.echangecadeauxSOCIALTraditional&#10003;\n    16lagamerie.nopeGAME_TRIVIAGoogle Sign In&#10007;

To compress the size of this package, We did not include the decompiled source code of each app. However, the decompiled tool Jadx v1.0.0 is provided here.\n\nExpected results are stored in docx files, where we highlighted the source and sink methods as well as which variables is tainted in each statement. For example, for the following code snippet:\n\n1  package ubc.junbin;\n2  class clz {\n3    String a = source(); // source\n4    String b = a;\n5    sink(b); // sink\n6  }\n\n\nWe presents the expected results as:\n\n\n  // expected source and sink are put at the top of a flow \nExpected source: source() \nExpected sink: sink() \n\n&gt; ubc.junbin.clz: // the class to locate statements \nL3: String a = source(); \nL4: String b = a; \nL5: sink(b); \n\n\nWe also provide a set of csv files that can be easily parsed automatically. Each csv file contains an expected flow. For example, for the above code snippit, the csv file may look like the following. The name of Class, LineID, and Line are extracted using Soot v3.3.0.\n\n\nIDClassLineIDLine\n0ubc.junbin.clzL3$r2 = virtualinvoke $r1.&lt;ubc.junbin.clz: java.lang.String source()&gt;();\n1ubc.junbin.clzL4$r3 = $r2;\n2ubc.junbin.clzL5virtualinvoke $r1.&lt;ubc.junbin.clz: void sink()&gt;($r3);\n\n\nThe following table detailedly presents information of these 26 selected apps, which consists of these columns:\n\n\n  APILevel: The API level of an app. We sorted all the apps by their API levels, from the smallest one to the largest one.\n  AppID: We numbered all Google Play apps we used, from 1 to 26, obeying the order of “APILevel”.\n  AppName: The full package name of the app.\n  Number of component(s): The number of Android components declared in the manifest file of an app.\n  Number of expected flow(s): The number of expected flows.\n\n\n\n    APILevelAppIDAppNameDEXSize (MB)# ofcomponent(s)# of expectedflow(s)\n    Login-related Google Play Apps\n    141com.echangecadeaux3.0311\n    172com.rtp.livepass.android6.4571\n    193com.tripadvisor.tripadvisor5.3\n    791\n    214ca.intact.mydrivingdiscount8.8421\n    5com.asiandate8.4391\n    226ca.passportparking.mobile.passportcanada14.01341\n    7com.aldiko.android9.5781\n    8com.passportparking.mobile.parkvictoria14.71371\n    9com.passportparking.mobile.toronto14.11341\n    10tc.tc.scsm.phonegap10.01161\n    2311com.onetapsolutions.morneau.activity10.21011\n    12net.fieldwire.app9.8281\n    2413com.ackroo.mrgas5.21815\n    2514com.airbnb.android65.42351\n    15com.bose.gd.events15.11571\n    16com.phonehalo.itemtracker16.7853\n    17com.viagogo.consumer.viagogo.playstore13.4201\n    18com.yelp.android20.53141\n    19onxmaps.hunt11.2581\n    Spyware Google Play Apps\n    2120com.mobistartapp.flashlight4.4577\n    21com.monitor.phone.s0ft.phonemonitor0.7712\n    2322com.mobistartapp.win7imulator3.9303\n    2523com.mobistartapp.windows7launcher4.67711\n    24com.tassaly.flappybird5.7657\n    25ma.coderoute.hzpermispro5.2927\n    \n    Min0.77\n    Max65.4314\n    Mean11.488\n    Median9.577\n    \n\nSources of failures\n\nOur analysis results can be downloaded here.

The table has two columns, which are:\n\n- **CriteriaID**: All new criteria we identified are indexed in the format *U-DB[cat].[index]*, where *[cat]* is the category of DroidBench and *[index]* is an index in that category; TO indicates cases where a tool ran out of time to analyze an app; UN indicates cases where the reason for the failure is unknown.\n- **CriteriaDescription**: This describe the details about newly found criteria.\n- **Tool**: The tool(s) where we identified the new criteria.\n\n{% include /table/tab_ubcbench.html %}\n\n## Download link\n\nYou can find our newly-developed benchmark suite UBCBench used in the paper [**here**](https://github.com/LinaQiu/UBCBench).\n\n## Fixed bugs\n\nWe identified eight bugs in *FlowDroid* when performing our analysis. Three of the bugs lead to crashes of *FlowDroid*. We notified the authors of these bugs, and worked with them to fix them. The below table lists these bugs with the following information:\n\n- **CriteriaID**: All bugs are indexed in the format *BUGx* or *EX* (for those lead to crashes).\n- **BugDescription**: Descrption and patches for a bug.\n- **AffectedApp**: The IDs of benchmark or Google Play apps that are affected by a bug.\n\n{% include /table/tab_bug.html %}"
