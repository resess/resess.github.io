						"content": "Benchmarks\n\nSources and sinks\n\nWe provided the list of sources and sinks we used for benchmark apps (SS-Bench) in Section 3.4.1 (Table 3) of our paper.\n\nSelected benchmarks and expected results\n\nThis section contains (1) the full list of benchmarks (from DroidBench and ICCBench) that we used in our study, (2) target criterion of each application, and (3) the ground truth we followed, determined by the list of sources/sinks and tool configurations we used.\nThere are seven columns in the table. Here we explain every column and provide suggestions to the readers about how to read the table:\n\n\n  Category: In DroidBench and ICCBench, authors put benchmarks to different folders based on what aspect of Android/Java the benchmark is designed to test. We extracted the folder name as categories, and numbered them.\n  AppID: We numbered all benchmarks in DroidBench we use, from 1 to 109, obeying the order of “Category”. The same to ICCBench benchmarks.\n  AppName: The name of the benchmark, which are extracted from DroidBench and ICCBench test suites.\n  TargetCriteriaID and TargetCriteriaDesciption: Each of the DroidBench and ICCBench application is designed to test a particular aspect of taint analysis, which we refer to as the Target Criterion (short as Criterion) of the benchmark. Developers generally annotate the criterion in source code. We extract this information from DroidBench and ICCBench applications annotations, which is the column “CriteriaDesciption”. For easy reference, we number each criterion in the format [Test Suite Name][Category ID][subid of application inside this category], for example, if we look at the first row, “DB1.1” means the criterion “Aliases must be computed precisely or a false positive will be found.” is tested by the first benchmark “Merge1” in the first category “Aliasing” in DroidBench test suite.\n  Number of designer’s expected flow(s): In DroidBench and ICCBench, developers annotated the number of expected leaks, which are what we extracted to this column.\n  Number of our expected flow(s): With our selection of sources, sinks, and configuration parameters discussed in previous subsections, the expected flows for each benchmark application might deviate from the result annotated by the benchmark designers. We thus manually analyzed each of the benchmark applications, extracting all flows expected under our configuration setup.\n\n\nAll benchmarks whose Number of designer’s expected flow(s) are different from Number of our expected flow(s) are highlighted in blue.\n\n\n    CategoryAppIDAppNameTargetCriteriaIDTargetCriteriaDescription# designer'sexpected flow(s)# our expectedflow(s)\n    DroidBench\n    1. Aliasing1FlowSensitivity1DB1.1Aliases must be computed in a flow-sensitive fashion, otherwise a false positive is found.00\n    2Merge1DB1.2Aliases must be computed precisely or a false positive will be found.01\n    3SimpleAliasing1DB1.3Aliases must be computed soundly or the leak will be missed.11\n    4StrongUpdate1DB1.4The alias analysis must support strong updates for not causing a false positive.10\n    2. Android Specific5ApplicationModeling1DB2.1Aliases must be computed precisely or a false positive will be found.10\n    6DirectLeak1DB2.2The value of a source is directly sent to a sink.11\n    7InactiveActivityDB2.3The analysis has to be aware that the activity is set to inactive in manifest file.00\n    8Library2DB2.4The analysis must correctly handle custom libraries.11\n    9LogNoLeakDB2.5The analysis has to be aware that no tainted value can reach the sink.00\n    10Obfuscation1DB2.6The analysis must not be fooled by fake implementations of system classes contained in the APK file.11\n    11Parcel1DB2.7Parcel marshall and unmarshalling.11\n    12PrivateDataLeak3DB2.8The analysis must propagate taints across file system accesses.21\n    13PublicAPIField1DB2.9Must have accurate modeling for API classes that expose fields.11\n    14PublicAPIField2DB2.10Analysis must have a model of Intent implementation to setter / getter of Intent fields.11\n    15View1DB2.11The analysis needs to properly include custom views into the lifecycle.11\n    3. Arrays And Lists16ArrayAccess1DB3.1The analysis must distinguish between different array positions to recognize that the tainted data does not get leaked.00\n    17ArrayAccess2DB3.2The analysis must distinguish between different array positions and has to evaluate the function to recognize that the tainted data does not get leaked.00\n    18ArrayAccess3DB3.3The analysis must support arrays.11\n    19ArrayAccess4DB3.4The analysis must correctly handle fields of objects inside arrays.00\n    20ArrayAccess5DB3.5The analysis must correctly distinguish between the size of an array and its elements.00\n    21ArrayCopy1DB3.6The analysis tool must have a model for System.arraycopy().11\n    22ArrayToString1DB3.7Have to model that Array.toString invokes toString() for each object of array.11\n    23HashMapAccess1DB3.8The analysis must distinguish between different hash map entries to recognize that the tainted data does not get leaked.00\n    24ListAccess1DB3.9The analysis must distinguish between different list positions to recognize that the tainted data does not get leaked.00\n    25MultidimensionalArray1DB3.10The analysis tool has to be able to track an element within a multidimensional array.11\n    4.

This example contains a location information leakage in the onResume() callback method. The data source is placed into the onLocationChanged() callback method, especially the parameter loc.22\n    33LocationLeak2DB4.8The analysis must be able to emulate the Android activity lifecycle correctly, integrate the callback method onLocationChanged and detect the callback methods as source. This example contains a location information leakage in the onResume() callback method. The data source is placed into the onLocationChanged() callback method, especially the parameter loc. In contrast to LocationLeak1 the activity implements the Listener directly (no inner class).22\n    34LocationLeak3DB4.9The analysis must be able to emulate the Android activity lifecycle correctly, integrate the callback method onLocationChanged, detect the callback methods as source and connect the callback class to the activity via the interface.12\n    35MethodOverride1DB4.10The analysis must be able to detect the leak in an internal Android method that is overwritten.11\n    36MultiHandlers1DB4.11The analysis must be able to correctly associate callback handlers with the respective activities.00\n    37Ordering1DB4.12The analysis must take the order of callback registration and sink call into account.00\n    38RegisterGlobal1DB4.13The analysis must support globally-registered callback handlers.11\n    39RegisterGlobal211\n    40Unregister1DB4.14The analysis must take into accounts that callbacks can be unregistered again.00\n    5.

Sends the IMEI as an SMS message and writes it to the log file. Emulator detection is performed on the IMEI and the app is killed if the IMEI is a 00..00 pattern.22\n    48IMEI1DB5.3The (dynamic) analysis must avoid being detected and circumvented. Sends the IMEI as an SMS message and writes it to the log file. Emulator detection is performed by cutting the secret message at an index computed on the IMEI which is known to always be 000..0 on an emulator.20\n    51PlayStore1DB5.4The (dynamic) analysis must avoid being detected and circumvented. Sends the IMEI as an SMS message and writes it to the log file. Emulator detection is performed by checking whether the Play Store app is installed on the system.22\n    6. Field And Object Sensitivity56FieldSensitivity1DB6.1The analysis must be able to distinguish between different fields of an object.00\n    57FieldSensitivity2DB6.2The analysis must be able to distinguish between different fields of an object. An object has two fields, the one that gets tainted is sent to a sink.00\n    58FieldSensitivity3DB6.3The analysis must be able to distinguish between different fields of an object. This is an easier version of FieldSensitivity1.11\n    59FieldSensitivity4DB6.4The analysis has to consider the order of the statements for tainted fields.00\n    60InheritedObjects1DB6.5The analysis must be able to decide on the subtype of a variable based on a condition.11\n    61ObjectSensitivity1DB6.6The analysis must be able to distinguish between two objects of the same type that are initialized by the same constructor.00\n    62ObjectSensitivity2DB6.7The analysis must be able to remove taints from variables and fields.00\n    7. General Java63Clone1DB7.1Must model clone of list.11\n    64Exceptions1DB7.2The analysis must handle exceptions.11\n    65Exceptions2DB7.3The analysis must handle implicit exceptions.11\n    66Exceptions3DB7.4The analysis must precisely model which exceptions can occur and which ones can't.00\n    67Exceptions4DB7.5The analysis must handle exception data.11\n    68Exceptions5DB7.6The analysis must handle exception data across method calls.11\n    69Exceptions611\n    70Exceptions7DB7.7The analysis must precisely handle exception types across method calls.00\n    71FactoryMethods1DB7.8The analysis must be able to handle factory methods contained in the operating system.22\n    72Loop1DB7.9The analysis must handle standard java constructs.11\n    73Loop211\n    74Serialization1DB7.10Must model serialization.11\n    75SourceCodeSpecific1DB7.11The analysis must handle standard java constructs.

We listed these applications in the following table.\n\nThe table consists of the following columns:\n\n\n  Category: The folder name that contains the application.\n  AppName: The name of the benchmark.\n  Reason: The reason why we excluded an application.\n\n\nFor category Inter-App Communication, there are 10 applications in total. These 10 applications form two IAC test cases.\n\n\n    CategoryAppNameReason\n    Dynamic Code LoadingDynamicBoth1Unsupported functionality: all three tools explicitly claim that they cannot handle dynamic code loading.\n    DynamicSink1\n    DynamicSource1\n    Inter-App CommunicationEchoer+SendSMS+StartActivityForResult1Disabled configuration option: IAC\n    Collector+DeviceId_Broadcast1+DeviceId_ContentProvider1+DeviceId_OrderedIntent1+DeviceId_Service1+Location1+Location_Broadcast1\n    General JavaVirtualDispatch4Disabled configuration option: implicit flows\n    Android SpecificPrivateDataLeak1Disabled configuration option: sensitive UI detection\n    PrivateDataLeak2\n    Implicit FlowsImplicitFlow1Disabled configuration option: implicit flows\n    ImplicitFlow2\n    ImplicitFlow3\n    ImplicitFlow4\n    ImplicitFlow5\n    ImplicitFlow6\n    Self-ModificationBytecodeTamper1Disabled configuration option: native code analysis\n    BytecodeTamper2\n    BytecodeTamper3\n    BytecodeTamper4\n    Native CodeJavaIDFunctionDisabled configuration option: native code analysis\n    NativeIDFunction\n    SinkInNativeCode\n    SinkInNativeLibCode\n    SourceInNativeCode\n    \n\nSources of failures\n\nIn this section, we detailedly list our manual inspection results about sources of failures on a benchmark basis. The table below have multiple columns, we will describe each column and provide instructions on how to read the table.\n\nThe table consists of two main parts, which are:\n\n\n  App and TargetCriteriaID: These two columns are information of benchmarks, matching AppID+AppName, and TargetCriteriaID in Selected benchmarks and expected results table.\n  \n    The left columns are all about results of studied tools. For example, if we look at the columns under FlowDroid, we list details about FP (false positives) and FN (false negatives) flows reported by FlowDroid. For each benchmark, we list:\n\n    \n      #FP/#FN: The number of FPs/FNs reported by FlowDroid.\n      FailingCriteria: Detailed breakdown of all FPs(/FNs) got reported by FlowDroid on the benchmark. The format is [Number of FPs(/FNs)]x[FailingCriteria of The FPs(/FNs)]. Note that we highlighted flows reported by tools which are not original designed for the tool.\n    \n  \n\n\nLet’s take the benchmark ActivityCommunication2 as an example, what we can learn from the table is:\n\n\n  FlowDroid reported 1 FP due to criterion DB8.2. Details about the criterion can be found in table Selected benchmarks and expected results.\n  Amandroid reported 2 FPs. One FP is due to criterion DB8.2, which is expected, and an FN is due to criterion UBC4, which is unexpected.\n  DroidSafe successfully handled the benchmark, with no FP nor FN.\n\n\nDetails of our newly-identified sources of failures (i.e., UBCx) can be found here.\n\n\n    AppNameTargetCriteriaIDFlowDroid v2.7.1Amandroid v3.2.0DroidSafe\n    FPFNFPFNFPFN\n    #FPCriteria#FNCriteria#FPCriteria#FNCriteria#FPCriteria#FNCriteria\n    DroidBench\n    1.

There are two differences in our experiments compared to the ISSTA’18 paper:\n\n\n  For selected Android static taint analyzers, we used FlowDroid v2.7.1 in this work vs. v2.0 in the earlier work, and Amandroid v3.2.0 vs. v3.1.1 in the earlier work. DroidSafe did not have any updates from the time of ISSTA’18.\n  For selected benchmark suites, we used DroidBench v3.0 instead of v2.0 as in the earlier work. We included 51 new benchmark apps from DroidBench v3.0 in out test suite. ICCBench did not have any updates from the time of ISSTA’18.\n\n\nIn the following two tables, we list benchmark apps on which different versions of FlowDroid and Amandroid reported inconsistent results. As we only ran benchmark apps in DroidBench v2.0 in our ISSTA’18 paper, we only present results for benchmark apps in DroidBench v2.0.\n\nSpecifically, these tables consists of the following two parts:\n\n\n  App and TargetCriteriaID: These two columns are information of benchmarks, matching AppID+AppName, and TargetCriteriaID in Selected benchmarks and expected results table.\n  Results of FlowDroid or Amandroid under different version. We list details about FP (false positives) and FN (false negatives) flows reported by FlowDroid v2.7.1 and v2.0 (in the first table) as well as Amandroid v3.2.0 and v3.1.1 (in the second table). We highlighted differences between two versions of each tool.\n\n\nDetails of our newly-identified sources of failures (i.e., UBCx) can be found here.\n\n\n    AppNameTargetCriteriaIDFlowDroid v2.7.1FlowDroid v2.0\n    FPFNFPFN\n    #FPCriteria#FNCriteria#FPCriteria#FNCriteria\n    DroidBench\n    11.

For example, if we look at the columns under FlowDroid, we list details about FP (false positives) and FN (false negatives) flows reported by FlowDroid. For each benchmark, we list:\n\n    \n      #FP/#FN: The number of FPs/FNs reported by FlowDroid.\n      FailingCriteria: Detailed breakdown of all FPs(/FNs) got reported by FlowDroid on the benchmark. The format is [Number of FPs(/FNs)]x[FailingCriteria of The FPs(/FNs)].\n    \n\n    Specifically for Amandroid, we also list the number of components timed out for each app.\n  \n\n\nDetails of our newly-identified sources of failures (i.e., UBCx) can be found here.\n\n\n    AppFlowDroid v2.7.1Amandroid v3.2.0DroidSafe\n    FPFNFPFN# timed outcomponent(s)FPFN\n    #FPCriteria#FNCriteria#FPCriteria#FNCriteria#FPCriteria#FNCriteria\n    Apps of API Level 19 or below\n    1. com.echangecadeaux011xUBC12011xTO23011xTO\n    2. com.rtp.livepass.android011xUBC255xUBC611xUBC100011xOOM\n    3. com.tripadvisor.tripadvisor11xUBC511xUBC10011xTO71011xTO\n    Apps of API Level between 19 (exclusive) to 25\n    4. com.asiandate011xUBC2011xTO2NA\n    5. ca.passportparking.mobile.passportcanada011xUBC9011xTO52\n    6. com.aldiko.android011xUBC2011xUBC104\n    7. com.aldiko.classic011xUBC2011xUBC102\n    8. com.passportparking.mobile.parkvictoria011xUBC13011xTO93\n    9. com.passportparking.mobile.toronto22xUBC511xUBC9011xTO21\n    10. tc.tc.scsm.phonegap011xUBC9011xTO83\n    11. net.fieldwire.app011xUBC13011xTO15\n    12. com.ackroo.mrgas22xUBC5001515xTO11\n    13. com.airbnb.android011xUBC2011xTO72\n    14. com.bose.gd.events011xUBC11011xTO82\n    15. com.phonehalo.itemtracker077xUBC122424xUBC1411xUBC1010\n    16. com.viagogo.consumer.viagogo.playstore011xUBC11011xUBC110\n    17. com.yelp.android011xUBC13011xUBC1021\n    18. onxmaps.hunt011xUBC13011xTO27\n    \n    Min0\n    Max93\n    Mean39\n    Median21"

The table has two columns, which are:\n\n- **CriteriaID**: All new criteria we identified are indexed in the format *UBCx*, from UBC1 to UBC14; TO indicates cases where a tool ran out of time to analyze an app; UN indicates cases where the reason for the failure is unknown.\n- **CriteriaDescription**: This describe the details about newly found criteria.\n- **Tool**: The tool(s) where we identified the new criteria.\n\n{% include /table/tab_ubcbench.html %}\n\n## Download link\n\nYou can find our newly-developed benchmark suite UBCBench used in the paper [**here**](https://github.com/LinaQiu/UBCBench)."
