						"content": "Benchmarks\n\nSources and sinks\n\nWe provided the list of sources and sinks we used in Section 3.4.1 (Table 3) of our paper.\n\nSelected benchmarks and expected results\n\nThis section contains (1) the full list of benchmarks (from DroidBench and ICCBench) that we use in our study, (2) target criterion of each application, and (3) the ground truth we follow, determined by the list of sources/sinks and tool configurations we use.\nThere are seven columns in the table. Here we explain every column and provide suggestions to the readers about how to read the table:\n\n\n  Category: In DroidBench and ICCBench, authors put benchmarks to different folders based on what aspect of Android/Java the benchmark is designed to test. We extracted the folder name as categories, and numbered them.\n  AppID: We numbered all benchmarks in DroidBench we use, from 1 to 109, obeying the order of “Category”. The same to ICCBench benchmarks.\n  AppName: The name of the benchmark, which are extracted from DroidBench and ICCBench test suites.\n  TargetCriteriaID and TargetCriteriaDesciption: Each of the DroidBench and ICCBench application is designed to test a particular aspect of taint analysis, which we refer to as the Target Criterion (short as Criterion) of the benchmark. Developers generally annotate the criterion in source code. We extract this information from DroidBench and ICCBench applications annotations, which is the column “CriteriaDesciption”. For easy reference, we number each criterion in the format [Test Suite Name][Category ID][subid of application inside this category], for example, if we look at the first row, “DB1.1” means the criterion “Aliases must be computed precisely or a false positive will be found.” is tested by the first benchmark “Merge1” in the first category “Aliasing” in DroidBench test suite.\n  Number of designer’s expected flow(s): In DroidBench and ICCBench, developers annotated the number of expected leaks, which are what we extracted to this column.\n  Number of our expected flow(s): With our selection of sources, sinks, and configuration parameters discussed in previous subsections, the expected flows for each benchmark application might deviate from the result annotated by the benchmark designers. We thus manually analyzed each of the benchmark applications, extracting all flows expected under our configuration setup.\n\n\nAll benchmarks whose Number of designer’s expected flow(s) are different from Number of our expected flow(s) are highlighted in blue.\n\n\n\n\n    CategoryAppIDAppNameTargetCriteriaIDTargetCriteriaDescription# designer'sexpected flow(s)# our expectedflow(s)\n    DroidBench\n    1.

The data source is placed into the onLocationChanged() callback method, especially the parameter loc.22\n    33LocationLeak2DB4.8The analysis must be able to emulate the Android activity lifecycle correctly, integrate the callback method onLocationChanged and detect the callback methods as source. This example contains a location information leakage in the onResume() callback method. The data source is placed into the onLocationChanged() callback method, especially the parameter loc.

Sends the IMEI as an SMS message and writes it to the log file. Emulator detection is performed on the IMEI and the app is killed if the IMEI is a 00..00 pattern.22\n    48IMEI1DB5.3The (dynamic) analysis must avoid being detected and circumvented. Sends the IMEI as an SMS message and writes it to the log file. Emulator detection is performed by cutting the secret message at an index computed on the IMEI which is known to always be 000..0 on an emulator.20\n    51PlayStore1DB5.4The (dynamic) analysis must avoid being detected and circumvented.

We listed these applications in the following table.\n\nThe table consists of the following columns:\n\n\n  Category: The folder name that contains the application.\n  AppName: The name of the benchmark.\n  Reason: The reason why we excluded an application.\n\n\nFor category Inter-App Communication, there are 10 applications in total. These 10 applications form two IAC test cases.\n\n\n\n\n    CategoryAppNameReason\n    Dynamic Code LoadingDynamicBoth1Unsupported functionality: all three tools explicitly claim that they cannot handle dynamic code loading.\n    DynamicSink1\n    DynamicSource1\n    Inter-App CommunicationEchoer+SendSMS+StartActivityForResult1Disabled configuration option: IAC\n    Collector+DeviceId_Broadcast1+DeviceId_ContentProvider1+DeviceId_OrderedIntent1+DeviceId_Service1+Location1+Location_Broadcast1\n    General JavaVirtualDispatch4Disabled configuration option: implicit flows\n    Android SpecificPrivateDataLeak1Disabled configuration option: sensitive UI detection\n    PrivateDataLeak2\n    Implicit FlowsImplicitFlow1Disabled configuration option: implicit flows\n    ImplicitFlow2\n    ImplicitFlow3\n    ImplicitFlow4\n    ImplicitFlow5\n    ImplicitFlow6\n    Self-ModificationBytecodeTamper1Disabled configuration option: native code analysis\n    BytecodeTamper2\n    BytecodeTamper3\n    BytecodeTamper4\n    Native CodeJavaIDFunctionDisabled configuration option: native code analysis\n    NativeIDFunction\n    SinkInNativeCode\n    SinkInNativeLibCode\n    SourceInNativeCode\n    \n\nSources of failures\n\nIn this section, we detailedly list our manual inspection results about sources of failures on a benchmark basis. The table below have multiple columns, we will describe each column and provide instructions on how to read the table.\n\nThe table consists of two main parts, which are:\n\n\n  Category, AppName and TargetCriteriaID: These three columns are information of benchmarks, matching Category, AppName, and TargetCriteriaID in Selected benchmarks and expected results table.\n  \n    The left columns are all about results of studied tools. For example, if we look at the columns under FlowDroid, we list details about FP (false positives) and FN (false negatives) flows reported by FlowDroid. For each benchmark, we list:\n\n    \n      #FP/#FN: The number of FPs/FNs reported by FlowDroid.\n      FailingCriteria: Detailed breakdown of all FPs(/FNs) got reported by FlowDroid on the benchmark. The format is [Number of FPs(/FNs)]x[FailingCriteria of The FPs(/FNs)]. Note that we highlighted flows reported by tools which are not original designed for the tool.\n    \n  \n\n\nLet’s take the benchmark ActivityCommunication2 as an example, what we can learn from the table is:\n\n\n  FlowDroid reported 1 FP due to criterion DB8.2. Details about the criterion can be found in table Selected benchmarks and expected results.\n  Amandroid reported 2 FPs. One FP is due to criterion DB8.2, which is expected, and another FP is due to criterion DB6.1, which is unexpected.\n  DroidSafe successfully handled the benchmark, with no FP nor FN."
