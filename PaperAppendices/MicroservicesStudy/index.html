<h1 id="interviewstudy">Interview Study</h1>

<h2 id="dataanalysisprocess">Data Analysis Process</h2>

<p>For open coding, two of the authors of the paper independently read the transcripts line by line and identified concepts - <em>key ideas contained in data</em>. When looking for concepts, we searched for the best phrase that describes conceptually what we believe is indicated by the raw data. On a weekly basis, all the authors met to discuss the identified concepts and to refine and merge them if needed. That was done using card sorting: each card represented a quote labeled with the concepts, and we grouped the quotes and refined the concepts, as needed.</p>

<h1 id="surveystudy">Survey Study</h1>

<h2 id="surveyquestions">Survey Questions</h2>

<p>The survey consisted of 13 groups of questions and a total of 38 questions of mixed types. Most of the questions were single or multiple choices, numeric range choices, yes/no options, and open-ended text entries.</p>

<p>In addition to the microservice background and demographic information, we asked questions related to architectural concepts, infrastructure, and code management. In each question, participants had a chance to either agree or disagree with best practices identified during the interview study, or identify their solution for a particular challenge. We also asked participants to distinguish between the solution they apply in practice (what they do) and their perception (what they think they should do).</p>

<p>Here is the list of survey questions:</p>
